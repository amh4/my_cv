### Who I Am

Software Engineering Bootcamp Graduate from Makers. Originally coming from a background in Asset Management and Startups.

As a Full Stack Developer I get to do the things I fundamentally enjoy; solving tough problems with creative solutions, being part of a team that works to build things and learn as I go.  

I've always been drawn to big challenges and after spending 5 years in Financial Markets where the environment is always changing and the depth of knowledge required is never ending, I decided to take on a new challenge after becoming aware of a problem that I wanted to try and help fix.


**A few things we achieved:**

## Experience :briefcase:
**Makers** (November 2022 - March 2023)<br />
Software Engineering Student

- Created a company that sourced classic cars in Europe, shipped them to the US and sold them.
- Generated over $50,000 in our first 12 months
- Given the timescales involved in our product life cycles we began the process prior to COVID. As the economic cost of COVID lingered with regards to container shipping cost, car parts manufacturing delays and the general economic downturn we made the hard decision to stop the business.

Working closely with our Tech Team we would map out what needed to covered in upcoming sprints to match business needs, organise testing parties before rollouts and help with the rollout of new features across the business.
- Adopted Agile methodolies for my own team such as daily standups and weekly retros. Whilst not being a tech team this helped us have great visibility over a large range of responsibilites. The weekly retros allowed us to objectively look at how we worked which was crucial to being able to adapt and deal with the consistent fast growth of the company.

- Oversaw the day-to-day management of our Carers across London. Starting with 5-10 Carers which grew to 25-30 in these early months. Integral to this was quickly building relationships and getting them to buy into our collective mission. From this buy in we were able to really push our growth to help more people.

## Hobbies

Going outside my comfort zone. Going to countries where I don't speak the language, no phone data and just going for it. Recently visiting the Matterhorn and we plan on going to Everest next year. I have played golf, tennis, football, rugby, american football, squash and my knees certainly feel like it. If you hire me apologies for the sound I make as I stand up from my chair, it's involuntary.
