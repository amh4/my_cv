### Who I Am

The most genuine way I can describe myself is someone that fundamentally loves to learn and build things. Whether it's learning via books, podcasts, youtube videos or meeting interesting people I enjoy it all. My girlfriend and I are due to move in together soon and her main concern is that our flat will look like a library...which it probably will.

I've always been drawn to big challenges where the learning curve never really plateaus. After spending 5 years in Financial Markets where the environment is always changing and the depth of knowledge required is never ending. I decided to take on a new challenge after becoming aware of a problem that I wanted to try and help fix.

Through personal circumstance one issue that my family got first hand experience in is how much the Home Care Sector is struggling in the U.K.

After some deliberation I left my career in Asset Management to join a brand new startup as employee number 4 and we were going to try to fix it. We focused on building the Tech for future of care at home for the elderly and disabled as well as delivering care too.

Joining at the very start was an incredible experience seeing all the people we could help, the tech stack we built and my own personal growth. I helped see the company through our Seed and Series A Venture Capital fund raising, managed a team of 50+ people.

**A few of things about what we did:**

[LaingBuisson Award for Innovation](https://laingbuissonawards.com/previous-years-2/)

I often think that I would need a thousand lifetimes to try and pursue everything I find interesting but sadly thatâ€™s not an option right now. After the worst of the pandemic was over for the healthcare sector I have taken the time to evaluate what I truly enjoy doing; building things, solving problems and being on a never ending learning curve. With that in mind and being heavily exposed to the tech development process at Lifted I decided to become a Software Engineer. Something which I can't believe I didn't think of years ago!

## Experience :briefcase:
**Makers** (November 2022 - March 2023)<br />
Software Engineering Student

- Adopted Agile methodolies for my own team such as daily standups and weekly retros. Whilst not being a tech team this helped us have great visibility over a large range of responsibilites.

Integral to this was quickly building relationships and getting them to buy into our collective mission. From this buy in we were able to really push our growth to help more people.

## Hobbies

Going outside my comfort zone. Going to countries where I don't speak the language, no phone data and just going for it. Recently visiting the Matterhorn and we plan on going to Everest next year. I have played golf, tennis, football, rugby, american football, squash and my knees certainly feel like it. If you hire me apologies for the sound I make as I stand up from my chair, it's involuntary.
