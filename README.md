### Who I Am

The most genuine way I can describe myself is someone that is incredibly curious, fundamentally loves to learn and build things. Whether it's learning via books, podcasts, youtube videos or meeting interesting people I genuinely enjoy it all. My girlfriend and I are due to move in together soon and her main concern is that our flat will look like a library...which it probably will.

I've always found that I'm drawn to big challenges where the learning curve never really plateaus. Early on this manifested itself working in Financial Markets where the environment is always changing and the depth of knowledge required is never ending. After spending 5 years in that sector I decided to take on a new challenge after becoming aware of a problem in this country that needs to be addressed.

Through personal circumstance one issue that my family got first hand experience in is how much the Home Care Sector is struggling in the U.K.

So what did I do?

After some deliberation I decided that I didn't want to ignore this problem and I wanted to try to help. I then left my career in Asset Management to join a brand new startup as employee number 4 and we were going to try to fix it. We focused on building the future of care at home for the elderly and disabled both from the Health Care side and the Tech side.

Joining at the very start was an incredible experience seeing all the people we could help, the tech stack we built from scratch to empower the families and Carers as well as my own personal growth. I helped see the company through our Seed and Series A Venture Capital fund raising, managed a team of 50+ people and became somewhat of a [Winston Wolf](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfwgmEn4oUc) from Pulp Fiction. If there was any a problem that had to be solved, I was there to help.

A few of things about what we did:

I often think that I would need a thousand lifetimes to try and pursue everything I find interesting but sadly thatâ€™s not an option right now. After the worst of the pandemic was over I have taken the time to evaluate what I truly enjoy doing; building things, solving problems and being on a never ending learning curve. With that in mind and being heavily exposed to the tech development process at Lifted I decided to become a Software Engineer. Something which I can't believe I didn't think of years ago!

## Work Experience

**Roland Bailey Imports US** (July 2020 - July 2022)
Co-founder

- Created a company that sourced classic cars in Europe, shipped them to the US and sold them.

- Given the timescales involved in our product life cycles we began the process prior to COVID. As the economic cost of COVID have lingered with regards to container shipping cost spiking massively, car parts manufacturing delays and the general economic downturn we made the hard decision to stop the business.

- We did succesfully ship and sell multiple cars over the period, navigating incredibly stringent paperwork, establishing a global supply chain, negotiating with suppliers.

**Lifted** (March 2020 - November 2021)  
Operations Manager

- Building out new systems and process across the business. Included projects like automating our Recruitment Funnel, building a Sales Pipeline and our own Track & Trace System. For example, the automation of our Recruitment Funnel reduced the processing time from 3 days to less than 15 minutes by combining apps to remove the need for manual processing.

- Helped shape the overall direction, sprint planning, bug capture/prioritisation across our apps. Working closely with our Tech Team we would map out what needed to covered in upcoming sprints to match business needs, organise testing parties before rollouts and help with the rollout of new features across the business.

- Adopted Agile methodolies for my own team such as daily standups and weekly retros. Whilst not being a tech team this helped us have great visibility over a large range of responsibilites. The weekly retros allowed us to objectively look at how we worked which was crucial to being able to adapt and deal with the consistent fast growth of the company.

**Lifted** (August 2019 - March 2020)  
Operations Analyst

- Worked closely with our Tech Team on our web app and mobile apps. Included helping plot the roadmap of feature rollouts, recording and reporting on bugs and passing these changes on to our Carers in the field.

- Oversaw the day-to-day management of our Carers across London. Starting with 5-10 Carers which grew to 25-30 in these early months. Integral to this was quickly building relationships and getting them to buy into our collective mission. From this buy in we were able to really push our growth to help more people.

- Created a [Python Programme](https://github.com/amh4/wellness_automation) to harness this data we had to start delivering care from a pro-active approach. This insight was then integrated into the regular healthcare checks our Care Team would perform for our Clients. Allowing them to spot trends and get ahead of potential issues.

**Parmenion Capital Partners** (February 2018 to June 2018)  
Operations Associate

- Assisted in the project to automate daily payment processing specififying and communicating the operational requirements for the new system accurately in meetings with the Development Team. Leading to a new system that saved up to 30 minutes of work per day.

- Part of the team responsible for processing all client asset movements accounting for millions of pounds each day.

- There was a strong culture of accountability and decisive action which helped to build trust both internally and externally. Where any issues were encountered an incident log would be recorded. Analysing why the issue arose, whether it was likely to occur again, our immediate action to resolve it as well as the permanent fix. 

**Hargreaves Lansdown** (January 2017 to February 2018)  
Investment Helpdesk Consultant

- Co-led a project to improve the client messaging system as the organisation grew to over 1 million clients. Successfully took the idea through the concept phase, management review and implementation. This improved the speed at which we could respond to client enquiries by 20 to 30%, thus maintaining a high level of service during a key growth phase.

- Established and developed relationships with clients from a range of backgrounds through face-to-face meetings, phone calls and emails. Prioritising the needs of the client, no matter how small, whilst always offering empathy and patience was fundamental to all of my interactions with our clients and foundational to a high level of service. This contributed to multiple awards for best customer service within the sector.

**Blueprint Capital - G7 Currency Markets** (December 2014 - November 2016)
Propietary Trader

- Responsible for allocating $6 million per week in trading volume across all G7 Currency pairs.

- Rapidly process information to make balanced investment decisions with solid risk management.

- Was the first trader to test out the remote working trading platform. Executing all trades off premises, testing the platform, reporting on issues and suggesting additional features to implement.

## Hobbies

Going outside my comfort zone. Going to countries where I don't speak the language, no phone data and just going for it. Went to the Matterhorn, going to Everest next year. Played golf, tennis, football, rugby, american football, squash and my knees certainly feel like it. If you hire me apologies for the sound I make as I stand up from my chair, its involuntary.
