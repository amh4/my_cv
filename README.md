### Who I Am

The most genuine way I can describe myself is someone that is incredibly curious, fundamentally loves to learn and build things. Whether it's learning via books, podcasts, youtube videos or meeting interesting people I genuinely enjoy it all. My girlfriend and I are due to move in together soon and her main concern is that our flat will look like a library...which it probably will.

I've always found that I'm drawn to big challenges where the learning curve never really plateaus. Early on this manifested itself working in Financial Markets where the environment is always changing and the depth of knowledge required is never ending. After spending 5 years in that sector I decided to take on a new challenge after becoming aware of problem in this country that needs to be addressed.

Through personal circumstance one issue that my family got first hand experience in is how much the Home Care Sector is struggling in the U.K.

So what did I do?

After some deliberation I decided that I didn't want to ignore this problem and I wanted to try to help. I then left my career in Asset Management to join a brand new startup as employee number 4 and we were going to try to fix it. We focused on building the future of care at home for the elderly and disabled both from the Health Care side and the Tech side.

Joining at the very start was an incredible experience seeing all the people we could help, the tech stack we built from scratch to empower the families and Carers as well as my own personal growth. I helped see the company through our Seed, Series A and Series B Venture Capital fund raising, managed a team of 50+ people and became somewhat of a [Winston Wolf](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfwgmEn4oUc) from Pulp Fiction. If there was any a problem that had to be solved, I was there to help.

I often think that I would need a thousand lifetimes to try and pursue everything I find interesting but sadly thatâ€™s not an option right now. After the worst of the pandemic was over I have taken the time to evaluate what I truly enjoy doing; building things, solving problems and being on a never ending learning curve. With that in mind and being heavily exposed to the tech development process at Lifted I decided to become a Software Engineer. Something which I can't believe I didn't think of years ago!

## Work Experience

**Roland Bailey Imports US** (July 2020 - July 2022)
Co-founder

- Created a company that sourced classic cars in Europe, shipped them to the US and sold them.

- Given the timescales involved in our product life cycles we began the process prior to COVID. As the economic cost of COVID have lingered with regards to container shipping cost spiking massively, car parts manufacturing delays and the general economic downturn we made the hard decision to stop the business.

- We did succesfully ship and sell multiple cars over the period, navigating incredibly stringent paperwork, establishing a global supply chain, negotiating with suppliers.

**Lifted** (August 2019 - November 2021)  
Operations Manager

- Building out new systems and process across the business and managing a team covering a total of 50 members. Included such projects as automating our Recruitment Funnel, building a Sales Pipeline as as our own Track & Trace System. These systems helped create a massive boost in efficiency as the business scaled rapidly. For example, the automation of our Recruitment Funnel reduced the time processing paper applications from 3 days to less than 15 minutes by combining apps to remove the need for any paper.

- In my own time on my Christmas Holiday, which my mum wasn't happy about, I taught myself some Python for data visualistion, using Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn to clean and plot the data. This started because I realised that our Carer App had useful data points on our clients' wellbeing such as their sleep, eating and hydration but we weren't utilising this data. Using Python to access and create insights off of this data we were able to deliver pro-active healthcare. For example spotting a steady decline in hydration level, a key marker for certain conditions.

- Joing an early stage startup meant I was able to help shape the overall direction, sprint planning, bug capture/prioritisation across our Apps and Administration Software. Whilst my team had their own priorities during these processes I endeavoured to remain objective advocating for items that would have the biggest impact on the business. One example is the introduction of electronic medication management for the Care Team vs a long list of Operations based features. Ultimately, this went on to make the Care Team far more efficient no longer using paper files, freeing up their time to focus on raising the quality of care.

**Parmenion Capital Partners** (February 2018 to June 2018)  
Operations Associate

- Assisted in the project to automate daily payment processing specififying and communicating the operational requirements for the new system accurately in meetings with the Development Team. Leading to a new system that saved up to 30 minutes of work per day.

- Throughout all projects there was a culture of accountability and decisive action which helped to build trust both internally and externally. Where any issues were encountered an incident log would be recorded. Analysing why the issue arose, whether it was likely to occur again, our immediate action to resolve it as well as the permanent fix. Because of this culture, I am now confident in adapting quickly to respond to unforeseen problems.

**Hargreaves Lansdown** (January 2017 to February 2018)  
Investment Helpdesk Consultant

- Co-led a project to improve the client messaging system as the organisation grew to over 1 million clients. Successfully took the idea through the concept phase, management review and implementation. This improved the speed at which we could respond to client enquiries by 20 to 30%, thus maintaining a high level of service during a key growth phase.

- Established and developed relationships with clients from a vast range of backgrounds through face-to-face meetings, phone calls and emails with the elderly, disabled and near end-of-life. Prioritising the needs of the client, no matter how small, whilst always offering empathy and patience was fundamental to all of my interactions with our clients and foundational to a high level of service. This contributed to multiple awards for best customer service within the sector.

**Blueprint Capital - G7 Currency Markets** (December 2014 - November 2016)
Propietary Trader

- Responsible for $6 million per week in trading volume across all G7 Currency pairs.

- Rapidly process information to make balanced investment decisions with solid risk management.

- Was the first trader to test out the remote working trading platform. Executing all trades off premises, testing the platform, reporting on issues and suggesting additional features to implement.

## Skills

#### Calm Under Pressue

- My calmness under pressure was a foundation that was set early in my career when I became a Trader. Having to rapidly disect everything from financial data to speeches given by politicians you learn to keep a clarity of thought and objectivity whe making high stake decisions very quickly, investing millions of dollars. Then when COVID hit, whilst working in Health Care, this calmness helped navigate an unprecendted situation.

- When we went into lockdown Lifted was delivering ~1,200 care visits across London each month. Almost overnight we had to implement our own Track and Trace system, as well as source and distribute 10,000+ pieces of PPE per month. At a time that would be prone to cause panic being able to remain detached and calm allowed me to see the steps we needed to implement such as, reducing Carer working circles to limit exposure, create our own 24/7 symptom reporting line and set clear comms channels with all our Clients.

- By introducing these changes in a logical order, communicating the changes to all stakeholders and implementing continual improvements we had zero covid cases throughout the entirity of the pandemic amongst our Clients, the most vulnerable people. I would just like to also ackowledge the Herculean effort put in by everybody at Lifted, we had a phenomenal team.

#### Communicating

- Working at Hargreaves Lansdown, helping to manage the assets of over 1 million customers meant you never know which client is going to reach out next. You very quickly have to gauge the individual, start to build raport and trust then change gears for whoever you may speak to next.

- When I moved to a leadership position at Lifted this ability to change gears rapidly was crucial when building bonds between teams, explaining objectives, delegating tasks and building a good culture when moving between meetings across Sales, Recruitment and the Tech Team.

- Whilst I would always communicate with honesty and authenticity I could see that the Sales Team have a different communication style to the Recruitment Team. When explaining the objectives to the Sales Team I would alter the jargon I would use, the caddence at which I would speak and vary the points of emphasis. By shaping the style of communication depending on who I was working with it means you can communicate a consistent point and that nobody is left behind.

- Whilst the ability to communicate across many stakeholders is important, I would always maintain honesty and authenticity. I gave a company wide presentation every week based on the previous week's metrics and there were occaisions where I was asked questions, sometimes by the CEO, that I didn't know the answer to. Rather than try to fumble my way through I would openly say that I didn't know but I am happy to find out the answer. Overtime this starts to build a culture of honesty and ownership through leading by example.

## Hobbies

Going outside my comfort zone. Going to countries where I don't speak the language, no phone data and just going for it. Went to the Matterhorn, going to Everest next year. Played golf, tennis, football, rugby, american football, squash and my knees certainly feel like it. If you hire me apologies for the sound I make as I stand up from my chair, its involuntary.
